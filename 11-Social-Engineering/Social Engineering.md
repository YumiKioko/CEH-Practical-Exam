# Social Engineering: Understanding the Human Hack

## 🧠 What is Social Engineering?

**Social Engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. It’s a psychological attack rather than a technical one, making it one of the most effective tools in a cybercriminal’s arsenal.

> 🛑 **Key Idea:** The weakest link in security is often the human, not the machine.
