# 🕵️‍♂️ CREEPY: Geolocation OSINT Tool

## 📌 Overview

**CREEPY** is an open-source geolocation intelligence tool that collects geotagged information from social networks and image hosting services to provide a visual map of a person’s locations and movements.

> 🎯 **Purpose:** Track and analyze the physical locations of targets using publicly available geotagged data.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 📍 Extracts geolocation metadata from social media (Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, etc.)
    
- 🗺️ Displays gathered location data on interactive maps (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)
    
- 🛠️ Supports multiple social media platforms and image hosting sites
    
- 🔍 Filters data by date, location, or source
    
- 🚀 Export collected data in KML, CSV, or GeoJSON formats for further analysis

## 🚀 Installation

### On Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install creepy
```

Alternatively, clone from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilektrojohn/creepy.git
cd creepy
python3 setup.py install
```

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide social media usernames, user IDs, or email addresses.
    
2. **Data Collection**: CREEPY scrapes geotagged posts and images.
    
3. **Visualization**: Maps and timelines show the movement or common locations of the target.
    
4. **Export**: Save data for reports or integration with other OSINT tools.

## ⚠️ Legal and Ethical Considerations

> CREEPY uses **publicly available** data, but tracking someone’s physical location raises serious privacy concerns. Always ensure you have legal authorization and a valid ethical reason before using CREEPY.

# 🔗 Combining CREEPY Data with Maltego

## 🛠️ Workflow to Combine CREEPY & Maltego

### 1. Collect Geodata with CREEPY

- Run CREEPY to scrape geotagged social media posts for your target.
    
- Export the gathered data as a CSV or KML file.
    

### 2. Prepare Data for Maltego

- If exported as KML, convert it to CSV or a tabular format that Maltego accepts.
    
- Ensure the CSV includes columns like:
    
    - `Latitude`
        
    - `Longitude`
        
    - `Date/Time`
        
    - `Source` (e.g., Twitter, Instagram)
        
    - `Description` or `Comment`
        

### 3. Import Data into Maltego

- Open Maltego and create a new graph.
    
- Use the **Import Entities from Table (CSV)** option.
    
- Map your CSV columns to Maltego entities:
    
    - Latitude & Longitude → `Location` entity
        
    - Description → `Note` or `Comment` attached to location
        
    - Source → Custom property or additional entity info
        
- Import all geolocation points as Location entities on the graph.
    

### 4. Visualize and Analyze

- Use Maltego’s graph features to:
    
    - Connect locations with timelines (date/time data)
        
    - Link locations to digital identities or social media profiles
        
    - Add additional OSINT entities (emails, domains, IPs) to enrich context
        
    - Apply filters and layouts to spot movement patterns or hotspots

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Use **Transform Sets** in Maltego to automate enriching locations with nearby infrastructure or ISP data.
    
- Overlay imported geodata with network or domain entities for full target profiling.
    
- Regularly update your CSV exports from CREEPY to keep Maltego graphs current.
    
- Customize Maltego entities to store extra metadata from CREEPY for richer context.
