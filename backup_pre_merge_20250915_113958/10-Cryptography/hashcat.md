## Basic Hashcat Syntax

```
hashcat -m <hash-mode> -a <attack-mode> -o <output-file> <hash-file> <wordlist>
```

- `-m` â†’ hash mode (number from your list, e.g., 0 for MD5)
- `-a` â†’ attack mode (0 = dictionary, 3 = brute-force, 6 = hybrid, etc.)
- `-o` â†’ output file (where cracked hashes go)
- `<hash-file>` â†’ file with hashes
- `<wordlist>` â†’ wordlist to use (like `rockyou.txt`)

## ðŸ“¦ Example Hash Modes from Your List (these examples are part of the information available from the official [Hashcat example hashes list](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes))

| Hash Name                 | Hashcat Mode (`-m`) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| MD5                       | 0                   |
| md5($pass.$salt)          | 10                  |
| md5($salt.$pass)          | 20                  |
| md5(utf16le($pass).$salt) | 30                  |
| md5($salt.utf16le($pass)) | 40                  |
| HMAC-MD5 (key = $pass)    | 50                  |
| HMAC-MD5 (key = $salt)    | 60                  |

 ðŸ“„ Example Hash File

For salted hashes, the file should have:

```
<hash>:<salt>
```

Example (for mode 10):

01dfae6e5d4d90d9892622325959afbe:7050461

Example Commands

Crack basic MD5 (mode 0)

```
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

```
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```


âœ… Crack salted md5($pass.$salt) (mode 10)

```
hashcat -m 10 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

âœ… Crack a **single hash without a file**

```
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked.txt "8743b52063cd84097a65d1633f5c74f5" rockyou.txt
```

âœ… Example of a **hash from /etc/shadow (SHA512crypt)**

```
$6$m6VmzKTbzCD/.I10$cKOvZZ8/rsYwHd.pE099ZRwM686p/Ep13h7pFMBCG4t7IukRqc/fXlA1gHXh9F2CbwmD4Epi1Wgh.Cl.VV1mb/
```

Command:

```
hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 shadow_hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

### **Important:** In the `/etc/shadow` file, each line includes multiple fields separated by colons, like:

```
username:hash:lastchanged:min:max:warn:inactive:expire
```

You must extract **only the hash field** (the second field) and remove the username and the trailing fields (like `:18796:0:99999:7:::`) because Hashcat only expects the raw hash, not system metadata.

To extract just the hash:

```
cut -d: -f2 shadow.txt > hash.txt
```

This cuts out only the hash portion, ready for Hashcat. In detail, the `/etc/shadow` line has this structure: `username:hash:lastchanged:min:max:warn:inactive:expire`. The `username` is the account name, the `hash` is the encrypted password (e.g., `$6$...` for SHA512crypt), and the other fields store system management info like when the password was last changed, how long itâ€™s valid, and when to warn or disable the account. Hashcat only needs the hash part (`$6$...`). Hereâ€™s a clearer breakdown of the `/etc/shadow` structure, with each field on a separate line:

- `username` â†’ the account name (e.g., `root`)
- `hash` â†’ the encrypted password (e.g., `$6$...` for SHA512crypt)
- `lastchanged` â†’ days since Jan 1, 1970, when the password was last changed
- `min` â†’ minimum days between password changes
- `max` â†’ maximum days the password is valid
- `warn` â†’ days before expiration to warn the user
- `inactive` â†’ days after expiration before account is disabled
- `expire` â†’ account expiration date (days since Jan 1, 1970)  

Keeping the extra fields confuses Hashcat and causes errors like `Token length exception`.

âœ… Example cracking result for the shadow hash:

```
hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hash.txt /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-1000000.txt
```

Example output:

- Status: Cracked
- Hash mode: 1800 (sha512crypt $6$)
- Hash target: $6$m6VmzKTbzCD/.I10$cKOvZZ8/rsYwHd.pE099ZRwM686p/Ep...VV1mb/
- Password found - stored in the "cracked.txt"
- cat cracked.txt

ðŸ‘‰ In this case, the cracked password was: `Password1`

âœ… Brute-force 6-digit numeric MD5

```
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt ?d?d?d?d?d?d
```

âœ… Hybrid wordlist + numeric append

```
hashcat -m 0 -a 6 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt rockyou.txt ?d?d
```

 âš¡ Best Practices

- Always test with `--force` **only if needed** (avoid if possible)
- Use `-w 3` or `-w 4` for faster workload on strong GPUs
- Add `--status` and `--status-timer=10` to see progress
- Save sessions: `--session=myjob` â†’ resume later with `--restore`

 ðŸ§© Example Salted Hash Handling

If your hash file has:

```
fc741db0a2968c39d9c2a5cc75b05370:1234
```

You would run (HMAC-MD5, key = $pass, mode 50):

```
hashcat -m 50 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

### ðŸ“‚ Where does Hashcat store cracked hashes (the potfile)?

Hashcat automatically stores cracked hashes in a **potfile** ("passwords of today" file), typically located at:

```
~/.hashcat/hashcat.potfile
```

This file keeps track of all cracked hashes so you donâ€™t need to crack them again in future runs. You can disable it with `--potfile-disable` or specify a custom location with `--potfile-path <path>`.
