## **Usage**

  1. **Start BloodHound** (GUI): Run the BloodHound frontend (graphical interface):

```
bloodhound
```

This will open a browser window with the BloodHound interface.

2. **Running BloodHound's SharpHound (Enumerator)**: SharpHound is the tool used to enumerate Active Directory and gather the data.

3. **Start SharpHound (Basic Enumeration)**: From Kali Linux or Windows, run:

```
SharpHound.exe -c All -ip <target-ip> -ou <organisational-unit> -domain <domain>
```

	Flags:

	- `-c All`: Collects all information (group memberships, ACLs, trusts, etc.)
	- `-ip`: Target IP to perform enumeration against.
	- `-ou`: Specific Organizational Unit to target.
	- `-domain`: Specify the AD domain.

4. **Analyzing BloodHound Data**: Once enumeration is done, you can import the results into BloodHound for analysis.

	- After the enumeration, BloodHound stores the results in a `.json` file.
	- **Load the JSON file into BloodHound GUI** to visualize attack paths.

Example to import data:

```
bloodhound -c import -i sharpHound_results.json
```

5. **Search for Attack Paths**: BloodHound allows you to visualize how attackers might escalate privileges in an AD environment. In the GUI:

	- Search for users, groups, and admins.
	- Look for "Attack Paths" — paths that an attacker could take to escalate privileges, such as exploiting group memberships, permissions, or trusts.

6. **Run BloodHound Queries (Graph Search)**: Use the **BloodHound GUI** to search for potential attack paths:

	- **Find Admins**: Look for users with administrative privileges.
	- **Privilege Escalation**: Analyze ways to escalate privileges (e.g., using group memberships, permissions).

#### **BloodHound Attack Paths**

BloodHound’s primary purpose is to find attack paths for privilege escalation in AD. Common attack paths include:

1. **Finding Users with Privileges on Sensitive Resources**:
	- Attackers may look for service accounts or users with delegated admin permissions.
2. **Kerberos Abuse**:
	- BloodHound can identify Kerberos attack paths like **Pass-the-Ticket** or **Golden Ticket**.
3. **Group Membership Exploitation**:
	- Find users who are members of groups with administrative rights over other systems or services.
4. **Lateral Movement**:
	- BloodHound helps identify lateral movement paths that could allow attackers to move between systems and escalate privileges.
