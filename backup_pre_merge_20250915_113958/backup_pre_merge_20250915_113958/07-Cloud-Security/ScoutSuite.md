## 🧭 Primary Use Case in Cloud Auditing

ScoutSuite helps auditors:

- **Enumerate cloud resources** and configurations (IAM, S3, EC2, etc.)    
- **Detect security misconfigurations** (e.g., public S3, open security groups)
- **Assess IAM policies** and privilege escalation risks
- **Visualize attack surfaces** across services
- Generate audit findings for **risk, compliance, and hardening**

## 🔄 Audit Workflow with ScoutSuite

1. **Credential Setup**
    
    - Ensure you have cloud provider CLI credentials (e.g., `aws configure`)
    - Use service account JSON (GCP) or login (Azure)

2. **Run ScoutSuite**
```
python scout.py aws
```

```
python scout.py azure
```

```
python scout.py gcp --service-account /path/key.json
```

1. **Review Output**
    
    - HTML report: `scoutsuite-report/scoutsuite_report.html`       
    - JSON for automation: `data.js`

2. **Assess Key Areas**:
    
    - IAM: Admin users, MFA, key age        
    - S3/Storage: Public buckets, encryption
    - EC2/VMs: Public IPs, tagging, AMI age
    - Security Groups: Open ports (0.0.0.0/0)
    - Logging: CloudTrail, Activity Logs, Integrity
    - Secrets: KMS usage, rotation

3. **Generate Findings**
    
    - Compare against CIS benchmarks, OWASP Cloud Top 10, or custom policy
4. **Remediate and Re-run**
    
    - Fix misconfigurations
    - Re-audit and baseline improvements

## 🔐 Example Audit Questions Answered by ScoutSuite

- Are there any **publicly accessible buckets**?
- Is **multi-factor authentication enforced**?
- Are there **IAM policies using wildcards** (e.g., `*:*`)?
- Are **RDP or SSH ports open to the internet**?
- Is **logging enabled for all regions and services**?
- Are **unencrypted resources or databases** present?

## 🛠️ Integration Use

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate JSON reports into pipelines for config drift
- **Compliance**: Map findings to CIS, NIST, ISO 27001 controls
- **Red/Blue Teams**: Red team uses to map attack paths, blue team to validate hardening
- **Governance**: Used in cloud security posture management (CSPM)
