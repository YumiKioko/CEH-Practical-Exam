# 01 - Information Security & Ethical Hacking (Overview)

**Purpose:** Short conceptual module — awareness of methodology and the legal/ethical context for tools you'll use in other modules.

**Key concepts to know:**
- Phases of ethical hacking: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, Covering Tracks.
- Rules of Engagement, scopes, reporting, and laws.

**Useful tools (contextual / for reporting and workflow):**
- `whois` — quick ownership lookup (also Recon)
- `git` / `diff` / `vimdiff` — compare notes, proof-of-concept payloads, and config changes
- Note-taking: `KeepNote`, `CherryTree`, or just Markdown files for evidence and reports

**Quick examples:**
```bash
whois example.com
diff old_config new_config
git init && git add findings.md && git commit -m "initial findings"
```
