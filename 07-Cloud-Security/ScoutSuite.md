## 🧭 Primary Use Case in Cloud Auditing

ScoutSuite helps auditors:

- **Enumerate cloud resources** and configurations (IAM, S3, EC2, etc.)
    
- **Detect security misconfigurations** (e.g., public S3, open security groups)
    
- **Assess IAM policies** and privilege escalation risks
    
- **Visualize attack surfaces** across services
    
- Generate audit findings for **risk, compliance, and hardening**

## 🔄 Audit Workflow with ScoutSuite

1. **Credential Setup**
    
    - Ensure you have cloud provider CLI credentials (e.g., `aws configure`)
        
    - Use service account JSON (GCP) or login (Azure)
        
2. **Run ScoutSuite**
```
python scout.py aws
python scout.py azure
python scout.py gcp --service-account /path/key.json
```

1. **Review Output**
    
    - HTML report: `scoutsuite-report/scoutsuite_report.html`
        
    - JSON for automation: `data.js`
        
2. **Assess Key Areas**:
    
    - IAM: Admin users, MFA, key age
        
    - S3/Storage: Public buckets, encryption
        
    - EC2/VMs: Public IPs, tagging, AMI age
        
    - Security Groups: Open ports (0.0.0.0/0)
        
    - Logging: CloudTrail, Activity Logs, Integrity
        
    - Secrets: KMS usage, rotation
        
3. **Generate Findings**
    
    - Compare against CIS benchmarks, OWASP Cloud Top 10, or custom policy
        
4. **Remediate and Re-run**
    
    - Fix misconfigurations
        
    - Re-audit and baseline improvements
